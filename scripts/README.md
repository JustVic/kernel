this directory contains a handful of scripts to help install the needed tools to build SOS. these scripts are run by the `make env` task in the `Makefile`.

if you'd rather install manually, [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/hawkw/sos-kernel/blob/master/BUILDING.md) describes what you'll need to build SOS and how to install it.

i've tried my best to make sure these scripts work correctly on most common platforms, but due to the wide amount of variation in possible build environments, i haven't tested them everywhere. therefore, i can't guarantee they'll work on _your_ system. if something goes wrong, please don't hesitate to [let me know](https://github.com/hawkw/sos-kernel/issues/new).
